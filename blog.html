      					<h2>TECHNOLOGY AND OUR LIVES</h2>
      					<h5>Technology, May 9, 2019</h5>
      					<div class="bfakeimg" style="height:350px;"><img src="images/tech1.jpg" height="100%" width=100%></div>
      					<p>The purpose of technology is to change the way of life. Machines and other technological gadgets were created to make life easier. It is very difficult now to imagine a life without our tech gadgets. It has become a necessity for us. The more we advance in technology, the more we become dependent on it. Everyone today is addicted to technology. Everyone is becoming more attached to screens than in real life. People are starting to prefer chatting online than to chat in real life. 
						    When I was a kid, we used to be out playing in the yards and ground a lot. Things have surely changed today. The kids now prefer to play indoors than out in the fields. Video games have evolved a lot as well. When I see the games that are coming out nowadays, I don’t blame them for wanting to play them. The gaming industry has come a long way. From Tetris and Mario Bros to games today like, GTA 5 and Witcher.<br><br>
						    Technological advancements have become a new metric for evolution. When we look ten years back, and where we are now we see a huge technological advancement. Things have surely changed a lot and is changing fast. Invention and development of Technology have changed our life positively and negatively. The new technologies and inventions are results of our curiosity, creativity, and problem-solving techniques. What else we will do on this earth if we’re not improving our self every day.  But it’s important that technological development should be environmental and human-friendly. Technology is a flower for life, not a productivity killer. We’re looking like a robotic human and it’s the biggest example of how technology has changed our lives positively and negatively.<br><br>
						    Technology is in the air, water, food, education, business, office, electricity, marketing, data storage, communication, cars, parking, traveling, foods, shopping, and banks etc. It’s almost everywhere and in everything that is involved in our daily life.</p>

      					<h2>Technology: A blessing or a curse?</h2>
      					<h5>Technology, May 8, 2019</h5>
      					<div class="bfakeimg" style="height:350px;"><img src="images/ai.jpeg" height="100%" width=100%></div>
      					<p >“Information technology and the Internet are rapidly transforming almost every aspect of our lives - some for better, some for worse.” Negative side effects can be found to everything in this world if you keep searching for it. Yes, technology has some negative effects as everything in life does. But, in my opinion it does more good than harm. Internet has connected people and families all over the world. The days of sad tearful goodbyes are gone now. Even from halfway around the world people can stay in contact easily. We also can learn anything we want to just from the internet. Lost objects, dogs and even humans are found through the internet. It is a wonderful place where people from all over the world connect together.<br>
                But it also has the potential to cause a lot of harm. Because of technology and the internet, news has the potential to go viral all over the world and since the information can spread extremely fast, it can also be used for criminal behaviors. And the criminal activities can also increase and multiply its damage. Cyber bullying, hacking, financial extortion, illegal substance trafficking, are some the types of crimes that the people can cause through the internet.<br>
                Internet and technology has changed every aspect of over lives. Water, food, education, business, electricity, marketing, data storage, communication, transportation, banks, shopping, dating etc., everything has been changed because of internet and technology. And so because of its core involvement in every aspect of our lives, things can go really wrong too. Since everything is technology based a skilled hacker can ruin a person’s life. Not only this, robots are the new talk of the town. AI is advancing at a very rapid rate so robot takeovers are also not too far into the future. The world has changed and is rapidly changing. Technology and the internet can become someone’s salvation or their downfall.</p>
